# Computer Organization & Design: Personal and Collaborative Projects Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the ECE411 course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2023. This repository serves as a personal review and a showcase of the projects I completed, ranging from individual assignments to collaborative works.

## Projects

### MP1: Hardware Verification Language (HVL) and Hardware Description Language (HDL) Implementations
- **Components**: Verifications of Multiplier, FIFO (First In, First Out), and CAM (Content Addressable Memory).
- **Special Focus**: Implementation of a Cacheline Adaptor in HDL.

### MP2: Design of a Multicycle RV32I Processor
- **Objective**: To delve into the intricacies of a multicycle processor architecture based on the RV32I instruction set.

### MP3: Advanced Cache Implementation
- **Details**: Development of a 4-Way Set Associative Cache.
- **Replacement Policy**: Pseudo Least Recently Used (PLRU).

### MP4: Collaborative Project - Pipelined RISCV CPU
- Collaborated with Dongming Liu & Elijah Ye (Good Teammates).
- **Project Scope**: Design and implementation of a pipelined CPU based on the RISC-V architecture, showcasing teamwork and some advanced CPU design techniques including M-extension, fully parameterized cache, L2 unified cache and simple prefetching. More details could be find in **folder MP4**.
